# ComponentTester

My attempt to modify Karl-Heinz Kübbeler's AVR Transistortester for more accurate and faster component measurements. In the future hopefully with the possibility of measuring, controlling and identifying ICs. For now I will use the Karl-Heinz Kübbeler design, with four channel 16-bit ADCs and DACs.

You can also view hardware related files (schematic, PCB layout...) @ [https://cadlab.io](https://cadlab.io/projects/componenttester)

## Directory Overview

* __Hardware:__ The schematic and PCB layout is here. For now, this project uses `Autodesk EAGLE`, but I may switch to `KiCad` once I'm familiar enough with it.
TODO: * __Firmware:__ The source code of the tester is here.
TODO: * __Documents:__ HW and SW documentation is here.
TODO: * __Software:__ Hopefully one day it will be possible to connect this tester to a computer and use the software in this directory for more complex testing.
