# ComponentTester

## Directory Overview

* TODO: __Hardware:__ The schematic and PCB layout is here. For now, this project uses `Autodesk EAGLE`, but I may switch to `KiCad` once I'm familiar enough with it.
* TODO: __Firmware:__ The source code of the tester is here.
* TODO: __Documents:__ HW and SW documentation is here.
* TODO: __Software:__ Hopefully one day it will be possible to connect this tester to a computer and use the software in this directory for more complex testing.
