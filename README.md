# ComponentTester

My attempt to modify Karl-Heinz Kübbeler's AVR Transistortester for more accurate and faster component measurements. In the future hopefully with the possibility of measuring, controlling and identifying ICs. For now I will use the Karl-Heinz Kübbeler design, with four channel 16-bit ADCs and DACs.

You can also see the hardware related files (schematic, PCB layout...) at [https://cadlab.io](https://cadlab.io/projects/componenttester) although the repo there is few commits behind.

I will try to stick to the [CERN Open Hardware License Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal User Guide](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/uploads/cf37727497ca2b5295a7ab83a40fcf5a/cern_ohl_s_v2_user_guide.pdf), but since I'm new to Open Hardware, that's not necessarily the rule. So please feel free to point out any deviations or errors to me.

## Directory Overview

* __Hardware:__ The schematic and PCB layout can be found here. I will also add exported files (PDFs...), as recommended in [CERN Open Hardware License Version 2 -
Strongly Reciprocal User Guide](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/uploads/cf37727497ca2b5295a7ab83a40fcf5a/cern_ohl_s_v2_user_guide.pdf). For now, this project uses `Autodesk EAGLE`, but I may switch to `KiCad` when I get familiar enough with it.  
TODO: * __Firmware:__ The source code of the tester is here.  
TODO: * __Documents:__ HW and SW documentation is here.  
TODO: * __Software:__ Hopefully one day it will be possible to connect this tester to a computer and use the software in this directory for more complex testing.
